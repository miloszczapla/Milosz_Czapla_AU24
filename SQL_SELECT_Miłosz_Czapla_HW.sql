--staff could work in several stores in a year, please indicate which store the staff worked in (the last one);
--if staff processed the payment then he works in the same store; 
--take into account only payment_date

--Part 3. Which actors/actresses didn't act for a longer period of time than the others? 
--The task can be interpreted in various ways, and here are a few options:
--V1: gap between the latest release_year and current year per each actor;

select

	a.first_name ,
	a.last_name ,
	extract(year
from

	f.film_id = fa.film_id
group by
	a.actor_id,
	f.release_year
order by
	year_gap desc
	--sorting descending, from biggest year gap

--V2: gaps between sequential films per each actor;
--
--It would be plus if you could provide a solution for each interpretation
--
--
--Note:
--Please add comments why you chose a particular way to solve each tasks.
--IDs should not be hardcoded
--Don't use column number in GROUP BY and ORDER BY
--Specify JOIN types (INNER/RIGHT/LEFT/CROSS)
--Use code formatting standards
--You cannot use window functions
--We request you test your work before commit it. Code should run w/o errors
